# Youtube-Data-Analytics.

Within this project, I would like to explore the following:

1.Getting to know Youtube API and how to obtain video data.

2.Analyzing video data and verify different common "myths" about what makes a video do well on Youtube, for example:

=> Does the number of likes and comments matter for a video to get more views?

=> Does the video duration matter for views and interaction (likes/ comments)?

=> Does title length matter for views?

=> How many tags do good performing videos have? What are the common tags among these videos?

=> Across all the creators I take into consideration, how often do they upload new videos? On which days in the week?
